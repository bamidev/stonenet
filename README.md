# Stonenet

Stonenet is a completely decentralized & censorship-resistant media publishing
platform & peer-to-peer network. It is designed to protect free speech, and does
this by putting all data in the hands of the people, rather than one (or a
handful) of servers.
Moreover, all content is only ever shared by those peers that have chosen to
follow the channel that it belongs to, so as to prevent participating in the
sharing of disagreeable content.

It has a simple user interface, which supports the idea of using it as a
micro-blogging platform. But there are no practical limits to the content that
can be published.

Stonenet is still in early development, and a stable release is just around the corner!
