# Stonenet

Stonenet is a peer-to-peer social publish-subscribe network, also known as a
decentralized social media platform. It is designed to protect free speech and
resist censorship. It does this by putting all data in the hands of the
people, rather than one (or a handful) of servers like other centralized and
federated designs.
Everyone moderates their own home feed, and content is only distributed by
those peers that have consented to do so, by subscribing to - and
thereby explicitly supporting said content.

Stonenet works because every participant in the network provides a certain
amount of disk space to the network. Everyone that wants to help out the network
even more than what is done by default, can put up servers to help improve peer
connectivity options and data availability, with as little danger as possible.
The use of cryptography in Stonenet ensures that nodes that choose help with
relaying are unable to see what they are relaying, and specialized storage nodes
would be unable to see what data they are storing. This can provide ["plausible
deniability"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability#Use_in_computer_networks)
in certain jurisdictions.

To increase the reach of your content, a Stonenet node can even be set up as a
web-server or ActivityPub server, so that your content can reach non- Stonenet
users on the World Wide Web & the
[Fediverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse).

Otherwise, Stonenet just has a simple user interface mostly befitting of a
micro-blogging platform, but without any practical limits to what content you
can actually post.

*Stonenet is still in early development. If you start using Stonenet, keep your
client up to date because it may otherwise become incompatible with the rest of
the network. Also, the user interface is incomplete and not yet ready for casual
users.*
