# Stonenet

Stonenet is a censorship-resistant peer-to-peer network for (micro-)blogging or
publishing media.
It is designed with the preservation of free-speech in mind, trusting in the
concept of the "Marketplace of Idea's".

Stonenet's highest priority is preserving the data of one's feed, so that it's
messages cannot be taken down by any one person, institution or goverment.
In order to accomplish this, Stonenet is completely decentralized, and stores
the posts of a feed among a network of its followers.

See the doc/ABOUT page for more info.

StoneNet is currently in an early stage of development.

## Roadmap

Currently, the following features are being worked on/to be expected:

- [x] Node-to-node traffic encryption
- [x] A decent looking (Web) UI
- [ ] An ActivityPub 'bridge' to allow people from the fediverse to follow your feed
- [ ] A friends list
- [ ] Ability to encrypt posts to limit visibility to only your friends
- [ ] Seperate stonenet-dedicated onion routing network for anonimising IP.
- [ ] A Raspberry Pi image with Stonenet preinstalled, to easily keep your feed alive
