# About Stonenet

Stonenet is currently nothing more than a daemon running on your system. It
connects you to the peer-to-peer network, and provides a user interface via a
local web server at the same time.
To open Stonenet, you need to browse to `http://localhost:37338`. There should
also be a desktop entry that you can use to open that link, which could be more
convenient.

## Comparison to other networks

### The freedom to choose the data you support

On some peer-to-peer networks, like Gnunet & Freenet, there are a bunch of nodes
run by a bunch volunteers that help with the storage of data on the network.
The nodes store and share this data whenever it is needed by someone. However,
the nodes themselves generally can't discern what they are actually storing, as
it is encrypted with a key that is shared externally. This provides plausible
deniability to the node operators, but that may not be enough to protect the
operators in all jurisdictions.

In other networks, like BitTorrent for example, the relevant data is only shared
between peers that actually intent on acquiring and sharing that data. This
makes running a node (or being a peer) much less dangerous for most people. As
long as the content you acquire and share fits within the limitations brought
upon by your local jurisdiction, the data would be able to flow freely without
fear of consequence.

That's why Stonenet uses the latter model.

### Accessibility

Stonenet should be available to anyone. Currently, the network is available to
anyone that has access to the internet. Or more specifically, anyone who can use
UDP or TCP over IPv4 or IPv6. Except of course for cases with a firewall that
blocks Stonenet traffic by deep packet inspection.

However, there is currently a limitation where peers behind a symmetric NAT
device will not be able to contact peers who are also behind a symmetric NAT
device themselves.
This means that in the case where there are only two peers online that follow a
particular channel, and they are both behind a symmetric NAT device, they won't
be able to share data.
This is a problem which is to be solved soon, but Stonenet is still in an early
stage of development, and this should only affect a negligible amount of users
anyway.

### Anonymity

Stonenet is built to protect free speech, but that means that anonymity is
important as well, as in some cases users can be at risk for sharing certain
information (e.g. whistleblowers).
Stonenet does not require a user's personal identity, as all channel and node
addresses are random, and profiles don't require any sort of personal
verification. All node-to-node communication happens over a secure connection
that prevents eavesdropping on the packet level.
However, all data transmitted over the internet uses an IP address, and an IP
address can be used to identify a node.

It should also be noted, that someone could search the whole network, and figure
out which node is following which channel. This could be linked to your IP
address if it is not anonymized, or it could be used to fingerprint a node
otherwise. It is also possible to 'lurk' a channel instead of following it,
which means that the network does not remember you as a participant, and you do
not participate in the sharing its data, you only download it when needed.
This way, someone could not find out about your channels of interest if they
searched the network. However, if the channel's network is filled with
surveillance nodes, those nodes will be aware of the data you're lurking for.
So even if fingerprinting by searching the network has become impossible,
fingerprinting via a sybil attack still is.
So if you want to stay anonymous, it is pretty important to hide your IP
address so that any fingerprinting can not be linked to the actual identity of
the peer.

Now, anonymizing an IP address is possible, but always comes with a tradeoff in
network efficiency. That's why it is not baked in & enabled by default.
The most common solution is to use a VPN to hide your IP address. This works,
but a VPN is usually a service that requires money and trust. Your VPN knows
your IP address that you're trying to hide, so it is not a perfect solution.
Moreover, the firewall of a VPN is generally more restrictive than the firewall
of a home router, reducing the degree of support your node brings to Stonenet.

An onion routing network could work in theory, although there isn't a whole lot
of good choice out there besides Tor, and Tor is not intended, nor designed
to be used in peer-to-peer networks such as Stonenet.

Therefore, there will be seperate anonymization network in Stonenet.
Participation in this network will be completely optional, and disabled by
default, because it will require the nodes to relay possibly disagreeable data.

## How it works

Stonenet is basically comprised of one 'overlay network', and many 'actor
networks'. An actor network is the network of the peers that follow a specific
channel.

A channel published a bunch of objects as part of the 'blogchain'.
Certain objects, like post objects, carry files with them, and each file is a
collection of blocks.
Each object is signed by the actor.

Each node of an actor network decides how many objects, files & blocks they want
to store, which gives the user the freedom to decide how much they want to
support a channel.

The public key and the hash of the first object for a channel can be obtained by
searching the overlay network. This will also give them a list of peers to
connect to in order to interact with the actor network.
Once on the actor network, one can search for all the objects, files & blocks.
