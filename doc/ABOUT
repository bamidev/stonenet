# About Stonenet

## The software

Stonenet really just consists of one piece of software. It runs a node on the
peer-to-peer network, and it can be considered to be the client as well.
You can run it on your desktop computer, or on a server. In both cases, you are
running a node on the Stonenet network, but there is a difference to what the
node can or will help with.

The user interface is accessible in your browser, usually at
`http://localhost:37338`. But on most systems you're probably using the desktop
app which obfuscates that fact.

## A data model based on consent

A number of popular peer-to-peer networks (e.g. Freenet) store data in the
network indiscriminately, which is useful for providing anonymity, but also puts
your node at risk of storing disagreeable content, even though you might not be
able to see it because of the use of encryption. Plausible deniability
might still protect you in such cases, but that doesn't mean everyone would want
to do that if they would have the option.

Other peer-to-peer networks, like with the Torrent DHT network, have peers only
share data inbetween the peers that have explicitly chosen to participate in
downloading and uploading certain torrents.
Stonenet is designed to work more like that, so that a user would always be in
control of the data they support.

The upside of this is that a peer of Stonenet does not necessarily have to worry
about contributing to disagreeable content. The downside of this is that your
content is only available on the network when you're online, when you have a
decent amount of followers, or when you do choose to host your content on a
server.
Really old data may tend to disappear as well, in which case you really would
need someone to put a node on a server, or just a big or loyal following.

However, there will soon also be 'storage nodes' on the network, set up by those
that are willing to do so.
Then, anyone whose following is not yet big enough, or that wishes to remain
anonymous, can publish their content at those nodes.

### Accessibility

Stonenet should be available to anyone. Currently, the network is available to
anyone that has access to the internet. Or more specifically, anyone who can use
UDP or TCP over IPv4 or IPv6. Except of course when dealing with firewalls that
do 'deep packet inspection'.
Nevertheless, all communication on the network is peer-to-peer encrypted, so
that it at least can't be tampered with based on the content that is being
communicated.

**Note:** *There still exists one edge case in which two peers can't communicate
with eachother. This is when the two peers don't have any overlapping transport
protocol options. This will be implemented soon though.*

### Anonymity

Stonenet is built to protect free speech, but that means that anonymity is
important as well, as in some cases users can be at risk for sharing certain
content (e.g. whistleblowers).
Stonenet does not require a user's personal identity, as all addresses are
random, and profiles don't require any personal information.
All peer-to-peer communication happens over a secure connection that prevents
eavesdropping on the packet level.
However, all data transmitted over the internet uses an IP address, and an IP
address can still unfortunately be use to try to identify who uses a node.

If you want to remain anonymous on Stonenet, besides not posting any personal
information yourself, the real trick here is to hide your IP address.
Now, anonymizing an IP address is possible, but always comes with a tradeoff in
network efficiency if it was built int.
That's why it is not baked in & enabled by default in Stonenet.
The most common solution is to use a VPN
This works, but it is not perfect.
An onion routing network would be better, and there is Tor, but Tor is famously
not intended to be used in peer-to-peer networks.
However, the reason for this really just depends on the context, and the plan is
to integrate Tor into the Stonenet client in such a way that anyone that wishes
to publish content with an anonymous identity, or follow such a person, can do
so through Tor without bothering the Tor network with any overhead.

## How it works

Stonenet is basically comprised of one 'overlay network', and many 'actor
networks'. An actor network is the network of the peers that follow a specific
actor.

An actor published a bunch of objects as part of the 'blogchain'.
Certain objects, like post objects, carry files with them, and each file is a
collection of blocks.
Each object is signed by the actor.

Each node of an actor network decides how many objects, files & blocks they want
to store, which gives the user the freedom to decide how much they want to
support an actor.

The public key and the hash of the first object for an actor can be obtained by
searching the overlay network. This will also give them a list of peers to
connect to in order to interact with the actor network.
Once on the actor network, one can search for all the objects, files & blocks
that make up the actor's feed.

An actor's feed is similar to a 'blockchain'. However, it is not a blockchain as
it is known from cryptocurrencies, it is more just a chain of objects which make
up the posts and profile changes of the actor.
To distinguish it from what is used in crypto, the term 'blogchain' is actually
used.
