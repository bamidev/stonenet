# Contribution Guidelines

Here are some guidelines to contributing to this project.

## Spaces or tabs?

Tabs. Tabs for indentation, spaces for aligning code after indentation.

## Committing

Be sure to only commit something once everything actuallycompiles and all tests
are succeeding.

## Fixing bugs

When fixing a bug, if all tests are passing and yet the bug is there regardless,
add a new test first, that appropriatly tests the functionality that is
currently failing. Then, fix the bug.

## The frontend

The 'user interface' is just a web server that runs locally.

All basic functionality of the UI should also work without JavaScript enabled.
JS should only be used to implement embelishments or extra's.
Nowadays, it seems a common approach to have the web frontend rely on JS being
available.
However, because the user interface for the Stonenet client will also
be used to host feeds on a regular website, I want to cather to those who
believe excessive use of JS on websites is a security and/or privacy
vurnerability.

## Bootstrap nodes

If are a developer that has been contributing significantly to this project,
and you want to help the network out by hosting your own bootstrap node, please
let me know!
I will add your node to the default list in the configuration template file.
