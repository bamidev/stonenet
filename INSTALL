INSTALL

Installing stonenet on any unix-like system should be quite easy. Non-unix-like
systems, like Windows, need some additional manual work, but it is possible.


Debian-based systems
--------------------
All you need to do is add the stonenet repo to the package manager, like so:
```
wget -qO- http://get.stonenet.org/gpg-key.pub | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb http://get.stonenet.org/debian stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stonenet.list
sudo apt update
```
And then you can simply install the stonenet package:
```
sudo apt install stonenet
```
That's it.


Other Unix-like systems
-----------------------
For unix-like systems not based on Debian, you can install it from source. All
that is really required is Rust's package manager `cargo`, for building the
source code. Sqlite3 would be nice, but it can be bundled into the output
binary if not available on the system.

Install Cargo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can use your system's package manager to obtain `cargo` in some cases, but
the Rust compiler needs to be new enough.
(Check `rust-version` in `Cargo.toml`.) Otherwise, follow this guide:
https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html

Install Stonenet
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Once `cargo` is available, you can build the source code with:
```
cargo build --release
```
Before we install Stonenet, check the variables on the top of the `install.sh`
file first.
These variables define the directories to were everything will be installed.
Moreover, the `SYSTEMD_PATH` variable can be made to be empty, if systemd is not
available on your system.
Once everything is configured appropriately, you can finally run it (keep in
mind to use root privileges):
```
./install.sh
```

Windows
-------
Currently, Windows support is not there yet.
